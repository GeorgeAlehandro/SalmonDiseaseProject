# SalmonDiseaseProject
M2 project of mathematics - Usage of matrices

## About this repo
The goal of this repository is to share the data that was used in our report for analyzing the phenotypes of salmon in order to predict the presence of a disease in a population of salmon based on one or a group of phenotypes. Due to the absence of any public dataset that concerns the salmon, we ran a NMF analysis over an artificial gene expression dataset just to demonstrate its applications.
